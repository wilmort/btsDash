# btsDash
### NYC Activist dashboard

### The Basics
btsDash is a project I volunteered to work on for the New York City Task Force of Ban the Scan, an anti-surveillance initiative under the umbrella of Amnesty International.

A question was raised by one of my fellow Ban the Scan volunteers, on the topic of surveillance camera distribution... Is there a connection between the density of surveillance cameras and the amount of crime? While begining to answer that question through data collected by Ban the Scan* as well as datasets from NYC Open Data*, the team discussed the value in having a visual representation of such questions to aid lobbying efforts, and so this project began.
